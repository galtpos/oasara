# User Testing Simulation Rules

When asked to review UI code or simulate user testing:

## Persona Awareness

- Always check `docs/personas/` for defined user personas
- Consider multiple perspectives, not just "the average user"
- Pay special attention to accessibility persona requirements
- Remember: each persona has specific frustrations and goals

## Feedback Style

- Provide feedback AS the user, not ABOUT the user
- Use direct quotes and emotional reactions
- Be specific about what element caused the reaction
- Include both negative friction AND positive delight moments

## Persona Quick Reference

| Persona | Key Trait | Watch For |
|---------|-----------|-----------|
| Alex (Tech) | Impatient, high standards | Performance, keyboard shortcuts, clean UI |
| Patricia (Busy) | Time-constrained | Too many clicks, unclear CTAs, account walls |
| Marcus (A11y) | Screen reader user | Alt text, headings, focus management, ARIA |
| Jennifer (New) | Skeptical, no context | Trust signals, jargon, clear value prop |
| Bob (Senior) | Cautious, needs guidance | Text size, click targets, clear navigation |

## Common Friction Points to Check

### Clarity
- [ ] Is the primary action obvious within 3 seconds?
- [ ] Are labels clear without jargon?
- [ ] Is the value proposition immediately visible?

### Usability
- [ ] Does it work with keyboard only?
- [ ] Are interactive elements obviously clickable?
- [ ] Can users recover from mistakes easily?
- [ ] Is loading state communicated?

### Accessibility
- [ ] Is text readable (contrast, size)?
- [ ] Do images have meaningful alt text?
- [ ] Is heading hierarchy logical (H1 → H2 → H3)?
- [ ] Are form inputs properly labeled?
- [ ] Does focus order make sense?

### Trust
- [ ] Are error messages helpful and human?
- [ ] Are credentials/accreditations visible?
- [ ] Is pricing transparent?
- [ ] Are there testimonials/reviews?

### Performance
- [ ] Does it feel fast?
- [ ] Are there loading indicators?
- [ ] Do interactions feel responsive?

## Output Structure

Always include in feedback:

1. **Severity**: Critical / High / Medium / Low
2. **Affected Personas**: Which users are impacted
3. **Specific Element**: Exact component or line
4. **User Reaction**: In-character quote
5. **Suggested Fix**: Actionable recommendation

## Example Feedback Format

```
🔴 **Critical** - Affects: Marcus (A11y), Bob (Senior)

**Element**: Search input (ProcedureSearch.tsx:43)

**Issue**: Input lacks visible label - only placeholder text

**Marcus says**: "I hear 'edit text' but I don't know what this field is for."

**Bob says**: "The hint text disappeared when I clicked. Now I forgot what to type."

**Fix**: Add visible label or use aria-label with placeholder
```

## When Reviewing PRs

1. Mentally run through each persona
2. Flag issues that affect 3+ personas as high priority
3. Note accessibility issues as blockers, not nice-to-haves
4. Suggest fixes, not just problems
