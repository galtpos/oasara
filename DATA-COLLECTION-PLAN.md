---

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

### Option A: Manual First Batch (Recommended)
Start with curated list of top 50 facilities:

1. **Create CSV** with facility data:
   ```csv
   name,city,country
   Apollo Hospitals,Chennai,India
   Bumrungrad Hospital,Bangkok,Thailand
   ...
   ```

2. **Enrich**:
   ```bash
   GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY=your_key node scripts/enrich-from-csv.js
   ```

3. **Import**:
   ```bash
   node scripts/import-to-supabase.js
   ```

### Option B: Automated Full Collection
Start scraping JCI directory:

```bash
# Install optional dependency for scraping
npm install puppeteer

# Run full pipeline
node scripts/jci-scraper.js
GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY=your_key node scripts/enrich-facilities.js
node scripts/import-to-supabase.js
```

### Option C: Hybrid Approach (Best)
1. Start with Tier 1 manual collection (50 facilities)
2. Validate quality and process
3. Scale to automated collection
4. Hit 140 facilities by end of Week 1
5. Continue to 661 over next 3 weeks

## ðŸ“‹ Daily Workflow

### Morning (30 min)
1. Review yesterday's import
2. Check data quality in Supabase
3. Verify facilities on map
4. Fix any issues

### Afternoon (2 hours)
1. Prepare next batch (50 facilities)
2. Run enrichment script
3. Import to Supabase
4. Quality check

## ðŸŽ¨ UI Updates for Scale

### Map Clustering (Week 1)

```typescript
map.addSource('facilities', {
  type: 'geojson',
  data: facilities,
  cluster: true,
  clusterMaxZoom: 8,
  clusterRadius: 50
});
```

### Search Optimization (Week 2)
Implement full-text search:

```sql
-- Already created in schema
SELECT * FROM facilities
WHERE search_vector @@ to_tsquery('heart & surgery');
```

### Stats Dashboard (Week 1)
