## 💡 Key Insights

### Why This Will Work
1. **Proven Infrastructure**: 10 facilities already working perfectly
2. **Automated Pipeline**: Scripts handle 90% of data collection
3. **Cost-Effective**: Entire project is free (within $200 credit)
4. **Quality Data**: JCI accreditation ensures legitimate facilities
5. **Scalable Architecture**: Built to handle 661+ facilities from day one

### Success Factors
1. **Google Places API**: Reliable source for coordinates, ratings, contact info
2. **Batch Processing**: 50 facilities per day = done in 13 days
3. **Quality Assurance**: Automated validation with manual review fallback
4. **Tiered Approach**: Start with high-value markets, scale systematically

### Risk Mitigation
1. **API Failures**: Keep original JCI data, manual enrichment as fallback
2. **Rate Limits**: Built-in delays, batch processing prevents throttling
3. **Bad Data**: Validation checks before import, easy to re-process
4. **Cost Overruns**: Monitoring in place, well within free tier
