- Links to facility search
- No complex interactive widgets yet

### Phase 2: Interactive Tools (Later) - 8-10 hours
- Cost comparison calculator
- Savings calculator
- Recovery timeline calculator
- Quality verification lookups
- Interactive maps

### Phase 3: Rich Media (Later) - 6-8 hours
- Video testimonials
- Photo galleries
- Interactive charts and graphs
- Live data feeds
- Patient story submissions

### Phase 4: Backend Integration (Later) - 10-12 hours
- CMS for content management
- Patient story database
- Real-time pricing updates
- Email capture for lead generation
- Analytics tracking

## Immediate Implementation

Given time constraints, I'll create:

1. **Functional hub page** with all 5 tabs ✅ DONE
2. **Content-rich static pages** for each tab (essential information)
3. **OASARA branding** throughout
4. **Mobile responsive** design
5. **Links to facility search** from all relevant sections
6. **Basic cost comparison** tables (not interactive calculators yet)
7. **Trust building** elements (JCI badges, statistics)

## Files to Create

## Total Estimated Time

**Full Implementation**: 40-50 hours
**Phase 1 (MVP)**: 4-6 hours
**Current Progress**: 1 hour (hub structure complete)

## Next Steps

Would you like me to:
1. **Create simplified content-rich tabs** for immediate deployment (4-5 hours)
2. **Build one complete tab** with all interactive features as a showcase
3. **Focus on the cost calculator** as the highest-value interactive tool
4. **Create a content template** for you to populate with your copywriter

## Recommendation

I recommend **Option 1**: Create all 5 tabs with rich content but simplified interactivity. This gives you:
- Complete information hub immediately
- SEO-friendly content
- Trust-building statistics
- Clear paths to facility bookings
- Foundation for future enhancement

Then we can add interactive tools in Phase 2 based on user analytics showing which features drive the most conversions.

Let me know how you'd like to proceed!
