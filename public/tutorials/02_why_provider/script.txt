If you're a medical provider serving international patients, I need you to hear this. I've helped thousands of providers and patients set up private payment systems. What I'm about to tell you can save your practice.

The payment system is rigged against you.

How many times has this happened: A patient pays with a credit card. You perform the procedure. Everything goes perfectly. Then three months later, you get a chargeback notice. The patient disputed the charge, and Visa just took the money back. No investigation. No appeal. Just gone.

That's 2 to 3 percent of your revenue, evaporating to chargeback fraud.

Or maybe PayPal has frozen your account. They do that to medical providers all the time. Twenty-one day holds. Account restrictions. Permanent bans with no explanation and no recourse. I've heard from doctors who had fifty thousand dollars locked up for months while PayPal "investigated."

And don't get me started on banks. The moment you start receiving international wires, you become a "high-risk" merchant. Higher fees. More scrutiny. Accounts closed without warning because some compliance algorithm flagged your business.

You're providing legitimate medical care. You shouldn't have to beg permission from payment processors to get paid.

There's a better way.

Zano and Freedom Dollar eliminate all of this.

No chargebacks. Once a patient sends payment, it's final. They can't call Visa six months later and take it back.

No freezes. No payment processor can lock up your funds or shut down your account.

Instant settlement. Money hits your wallet in minutes, not business days.

And the fees? Nearly free. Not 3 percent. Not 5 percent. A fraction of a cent.

Your patients want to pay you this way. The smart ones are already looking for providers who accept private payments.

Ready to get set up? Give yourself about 20 minutes the first time, and take it slow. There's no rush.

You just took the first step by understanding WHY this matters for your practice. That's real progress. Let's get you set up.
