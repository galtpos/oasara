00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
# Create Your Zano Wallet  Open the Zano wallet.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
The first time you open it, you'll see this welcome screen.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
This is where you'll create YOUR wallet - a wallet that belongs only to you.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Press your finger on the button that says Create New Wallet.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
This will generate a brand new wallet just for you.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Give your wallet a name.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
This is just for you to recognize it.

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Type something simple like My Zano Wallet or your first name.

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Now create a password.

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
This password protects YOUR wallet on YOUR computer.

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Choose something you can remember but others cannot guess.

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Write it down and keep it somewhere safe - NOT on your computer.

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Type your password again to confirm it.

14
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Take your time - accuracy matters more than speed.

15
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
STOP.

16
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
This is the most important screen you will ever see.

17
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
These words are your RECOVERY SEED.

18
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
They ARE your wallet.

19
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Anyone who has these words can access your money.

20
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Write them down on PAPER.

21
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Not on your computer.

22
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
PAPER.

23
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Store that paper somewhere safe - a lockbox, a safe, somewhere secure.

24
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Write down every word in order.

25
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
One through twenty-four.

26
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Double-check each word.

27
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
A single wrong letter could lock you out forever.

28
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,000
These words are more valuable than gold.

29
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Treat them that way.

30
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,000
The wallet will now ask you to verify some words.

31
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,000
This confirms you wrote them down correctly.

32
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Look at your paper and type the words it asks for.

33
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Congratulations.

34
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:50,000
You have created YOUR wallet.

35
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,000
This wallet belongs to you and only you.

36
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,000
No bank can freeze it.

37
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,000
No government can seize it.

38
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:10,000
You are now in control of your own financial destiny.

39
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,000
This is your wallet dashboard.

40
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,000
From here you can receive payments, send payments, and check your balance.

41
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,000
In the next tutorial, we'll show you how to receive your first Zano.

42
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:30,000
You have taken a powerful step today.

43
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,000
You created a wallet that YOU control.

44
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Remember: keep your recovery words SAFE.

45
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,000
They are your financial freedom.
