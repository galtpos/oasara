## Opening (Before Screenshots)

**[INTRO - 15 seconds]**

> "Have you ever wished you had a bank account that no government could freeze, no corporation could spy on, and no inflation could erode? Well, you're about to create one. In the next few minutes, I'll walk you through setting up your very own Zano privacy wallet. Don't worry - if you can use a smartphone, you can do this. Let's get started."

---

## Step 1: Create Your Secret Code

**[Show: step_01_01_enter_pin.png - 20 seconds]**

> "First things first - you need to create a PIN code. Think of this like the combination to a safe. Pick four numbers that you'll remember, but here's the important part: don't use your birthday. That's the first thing anyone trying to break in would guess.
>
> Your anniversary might work... assuming you remember it. I won't judge."

---

## Step 2: Confirm Your PIN

**[Show: step_02_02_confirm_pin.png - 10 seconds]**

> "Now type those same four numbers again. Yes, we're asking you to do something you just did. It's annoying, but it catches typos. Trust the process."

---

## Step 3: Your Wallet Home

**[Show: step_03_03_wallet_options.png - 15 seconds]**

> "Welcome to your wallet home screen. Right now it's empty - like a new house before you move in. See that 'Add Wallet' button at the bottom? That's where we're headed. Tap it."

---

## Step 4: Name Your Wallet

**[Show: step_04_04_create_wallet_form.png - 15 seconds]**

> "Time to name your wallet. Think of it like naming a savings account. 'Vacation Fund,' 'Emergency Cash,' 'Freedom Money' - whatever speaks to you.
>
> Pro tip: Don't name it 'My Life Savings.' Let's not make it easy for the bad guys."

---

## Step 5: Add a Password

**[Show: step_05_05_wallet_name_entered.png - 20 seconds]**

> "Now we're adding a password. 'Wait,' you might say, 'didn't I just create a PIN?' Yes, you did. This is double protection. The PIN opens the app. The password opens this specific wallet.
>
> Two locks are better than one. Write this password down somewhere safe - not on a sticky note on your monitor.
>
> And if you forget this password? Don't panic. Those 25 words we're about to create can restore everything. The password just protects this specific device."

---

## Step 6: Ready to Create

**[Show: step_06_06_form_filled.png - 10 seconds]**

> "You've filled out all the paperwork. Now tap 'Create new Wallet' at the bottom. It's like signing the closing documents on a house, except way less stressful and no one's asking for your firstborn as a down payment."

---

## Step 7: The Most Important Step

**[Show: step_07_07_recovery_info.png - 25 seconds]**

> "Okay, pause. I need you to actually stop and listen to this part.
>
> What you're about to see is the single most important thing in this entire process. It's called your recovery phrase - 25 words that ARE your wallet.
>
> Before you tap that button, I need you to grab a pen and paper. Not later. Not 'I'll remember it.' Right now.
>
> Seriously. I'll wait. Go get that pen."

**[Pause 3 seconds]**

> "Got it? Good. Let's continue."

---

## Step 8: Your 25 Recovery Words

**[Show: step_08_08_seed_phrase.png - 40 seconds]**

> "Here they are. Twenty-five random words. They look meaningless, but these words ARE your wallet. Let me explain what that means:
>
> If you lose your phone tomorrow, these 25 words let you restore your entire wallet on a new device. Every coin. Every transaction. Everything.
>
> But here's the flip side - and this is critical - if someone else gets these words, they get your money. All of it. Gone. No bank to call. No fraud department. No reversing the transaction.
>
> Take your time here. There's no timer. This is your money we're protecting.
>
> So write them down. Check them twice. Not sure your handwriting is right? Tap 'Copy' first, paste into a notes app, then verify what you wrote matches.
>
> Then hide them like your grandmother hid her secret recipes - somewhere only you know about.
>
> Never, ever share these words with anyone. Not tech support. Not your bank. Not even if someone claiming to be from Zano asks for them. We will never ask. Anyone who does is trying to rob you."

## Step 9: Congratulations!

**[Show: step_09_09_wallet_created.png - 15 seconds]**

> "And just like that - you did it! You now have a private digital wallet that you, and only you, control. No bank can freeze it. No government can seize it. No corporation is tracking every purchase.
>
> Welcome to financial freedom. No suit and tie required."

---

## Step 10: Your Dashboard

**[Show: step_10_10_wallet_dashboard.png - 20 seconds]**

> "This is your wallet dashboard. Think of it like your bank account summary page. Your balance is up top - zero for now, but that's about to change.
>
> Below you'll see buttons for the things you'll do most: Send money out, Receive money in. Simple as that. Let's look at those next."

---

## Step 11: Receiving Money

**[Show: step_11_11_receive_screen.png - 20 seconds]**

> "Want someone to send you money? Tap 'Receive' and you'll see this screen. That big square is a QR code - it's like your mailing address in scannable form.
>
> Here's the good news: this address is completely safe to share. It's public, like your email address. People can send money TO you using this, but they can't take money FROM you.
>
> Think of it like giving someone your P.O. Box number, not your house keys."

---

## Step 12: Sending Money

**[Show: step_12_12_send_screen.png - 25 seconds]**

> "When you're ready to send money to someone else, tap 'Send.' You'll enter their wallet address - that long string of letters and numbers - and the amount.
>
> One very important warning: triple-check that address before you hit send. Unlike that embarrassing email you sent to the wrong person, crypto transactions cannot be unsent. Cannot be reversed. Cannot be undone.
>
> Copy and paste addresses whenever possible. Don't try to type them manually. Your fingers will thank you, and so will your wallet.
>
> And if you do make a mistake? Your only hope is to contact the person who received it and ask them nicely to send it back. They're the only ones who can. So... don't make mistakes. Check three times."

---

## Closing

**[OUTRO - 20 seconds]**

> "That's it. You've just set up your first privacy wallet. You now have something most people don't - a financial tool that actually belongs to you.
>
> Remember: guard those 25 words like your life depends on it. Because your financial freedom does.
>
> For more tutorials on using your new wallet - sending, receiving, and keeping your funds secure - check out the other guides in this series.
>
> You just took your financial future into your own hands. That's not nothing. That's everything.
>
> Welcome aboard."
