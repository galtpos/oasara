This is the most important video in this series. We're going to create your wallet and secure it properly.

I need you to understand something before we start: Your recovery phrase is your wallet. Whoever has those 25 words controls your money. If you lose them, no one can help you. If someone else gets them, they can take everything.

This isn't like a bank account. There's no customer service. There's no "forgot password" button. This is real sovereignty, which means real responsibility.

Ready? Let's do this.

Open your Zano wallet app. Click "Create New Wallet."

Enter a name. Something you'll recognize. Medical Fund, Travel Savings, whatever makes sense to you.

Now create a strong password. Twelve characters minimum. Mix uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols. This password only protects the wallet on this specific device. It's not your backup.

Click create, and the app will generate your 25-word recovery phrase.

Stop. Do not screenshot this. Do not copy it to your clipboard. Do not save it in a text file or notes app.

Get a pen. Get paper. Physical paper.

Write down every single word, in order, numbered 1 through 25. Take your time. Check your spelling. Read it back to yourself.

Here's a tip: If you're unsure about a word, you can take a quick photo of the screen to verify your handwriting, then delete that photo immediately after.

Done? Now do it again on a second piece of paper. You want two physical copies stored in different locations.

Where should you store them? Think about where you'd store a birth certificate or passport. A home safe. A bank safety deposit box. A fireproof lockbox at a family member's house. Not in your email. Not in Dropbox. Not in any cloud service. Paper, locked away, in two separate locations.

Now the wallet app is going to test you. It'll ask you to enter specific words from your phrase. This confirms you wrote them down correctly. Enter the words it asks for.

Verified? Your wallet is created.

You now have a fully functional, private financial account that no bank controls. No government can freeze. No corporation can close.

But remember: with sovereignty comes responsibility. Those 25 words are everything. Protect them like your financial life depends on it. Because it does.

One more thing. I will never ask you for your recovery words. No one from Daylight Freedom, Oasara, or Zano will ever ask for them. Anyone who asks is a scammer. Period.

Write that down too if you need to.

Before you continue, verify: Do you have your 25 words written on paper in two separate locations? Can you open your wallet and see a zero balance? If yes, you just earned your Key Holder credential. That's real progress.

Next, we'll get some Freedom Dollars into your wallet.
