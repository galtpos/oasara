Open your Zano wallet. See your balance at the top. Now tap Browser at the bottom of your screen.

You'll see your saved bookmarks. Tap Freedom Dollar to open the swap page.

This is the Freedom Dollar swap. Here you exchange ZANO for fUSD - a private stablecoin worth exactly one US dollar. Tap Connect Wallet.

Your wallet asks permission. This is safe - you always control your funds. Tap Done to continue.

Now enter how much fUSD you want. The page shows your ZANO balance and current exchange rate. Let's enter two.

Two fUSD costs about point two ZANO. No hidden fees. No middlemen. No bank approval needed.

When you're ready, tap Get fUSD.

Review the details. You're sending ZANO, receiving fUSD. Tap Confirm.

The swap is processing. Your wallet updates automatically.

Go back to your wallet. You now have two Freedom Dollars. Private. Stable. Completely under your control. No bank can freeze them. No government can seize them. This is financial freedom.
