1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,237
Have you ever wished you had a bank account that

2
00:00:02,237 --> 00:00:04,475
no government could freeze, no corporation could spy on, and

3
00:00:04,475 --> 00:00:06,713
no inflation could erode?

4
00:00:06,713 --> 00:00:08,951
Well, you're about to create one.

5
00:00:08,951 --> 00:00:11,189
In the next few minutes, I'll walk you through setting

6
00:00:11,189 --> 00:00:13,426
up your very own Zano privacy wallet.

7
00:00:13,426 --> 00:00:15,664
Don't worry - if you can use a smartphone, you

8
00:00:15,664 --> 00:00:17,902
can do this.

9
00:00:17,902 --> 00:00:20,140
Let's get started.

10
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:21,838
First things first - you need to create a PIN

11
00:00:21,838 --> 00:00:23,536
code.

12
00:00:23,536 --> 00:00:25,234
Think of this like the combination to a safe.

13
00:00:25,234 --> 00:00:26,932
Pick four numbers that you'll remember, but here's the important

14
00:00:26,932 --> 00:00:28,630
part: don't use your birthday.

15
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:30,328
That's the first thing anyone trying to break in would

16
00:00:30,328 --> 00:00:32,026
guess.

17
00:00:32,026 --> 00:00:33,724
Your anniversary might work...

18
00:00:33,724 --> 00:00:35,421
assuming you remember it.

19
00:00:35,421 --> 00:00:37,119
I won't judge.

20
00:00:37,119 --> 00:00:39,150
Now type those same four numbers again.

21
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:41,181
Yes, we're asking you to do something you just did.

22
00:00:41,181 --> 00:00:43,212
It's annoying, but it catches typos.

23
00:00:43,212 --> 00:00:45,244
Trust the process.

24
00:00:45,244 --> 00:00:46,820
Welcome to your wallet home screen.

25
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:48,396
Right now it's empty - like a new house before

26
00:00:48,396 --> 00:00:49,972
you move in.

27
00:00:49,972 --> 00:00:51,548
See that 'Add Wallet' button at the bottom?

28
00:00:51,548 --> 00:00:53,124
That's where we're headed.

29
00:00:53,124 --> 00:00:54,700
Tap it.

30
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:57,460
Time to name your wallet.

31
00:00:57,460 --> 00:01:00,220
Think of it like naming a savings account.

32
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:02,981
'Vacation Fund,' 'Emergency Cash,' 'Freedom Money' - whatever speaks to

33
00:01:02,981 --> 00:01:05,741
you.

34
00:01:05,741 --> 00:01:08,501
Pro tip: Don't name it 'My Life Savings.' Let's not

35
00:01:08,501 --> 00:01:11,261
make it easy for the bad guys.

36
00:01:11,261 --> 00:01:13,361
Now we're adding a password.

37
00:01:13,361 --> 00:01:15,461
'Wait,' you might say, 'didn't I just create a PIN?'

38
00:01:15,461 --> 00:01:17,561
Yes, you did.

39
00:01:17,561 --> 00:01:19,661
This is double protection.

40
00:01:19,661 --> 00:01:21,761
The PIN opens the app.

41
00:01:21,761 --> 00:01:23,860
The password opens this specific wallet.

42
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:25,960
Two locks are better than one.

43
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:28,060
Write this password down somewhere safe - not on a

44
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:30,160
sticky note on your monitor.

45
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:32,260
And if you forget this password?

46
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:34,360
Don't panic.

47
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:36,460
Those 25 words we're about to create can restore everything.

48
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:38,559
The password just protects this specific device.

49
00:01:38,559 --> 00:01:40,869
You've filled out all the paperwork.

50
00:01:40,869 --> 00:01:43,178
Now tap 'Create new Wallet' at the bottom.

51
00:01:43,178 --> 00:01:45,487
It's like signing the closing documents on a house, except

52
00:01:45,487 --> 00:01:47,796
way less stressful and no one's asking for your firstborn

53
00:01:47,796 --> 00:01:50,105
as a down payment.

54
00:01:50,105 --> 00:01:51,533
Okay, pause.

55
00:01:51,533 --> 00:01:52,960
I need you to actually stop and listen to this

56
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,388
part.

57
00:01:54,388 --> 00:01:55,815
What you're about to see is the single most important

58
00:01:55,815 --> 00:01:57,243
thing in this entire process.

59
00:01:57,243 --> 00:01:58,671
It's called your recovery phrase - 25 words that ARE

60
00:01:58,671 --> 00:02:00,098
your wallet.

61
00:02:00,098 --> 00:02:01,526
Before you tap that button, I need you to grab

62
00:02:01,526 --> 00:02:02,953
a pen and paper.

63
00:02:02,953 --> 00:02:04,381
Not later.

64
00:02:04,381 --> 00:02:05,808
Not 'I'll remember it.' Right now.

65
00:02:05,808 --> 00:02:07,236
Seriously.

66
00:02:07,236 --> 00:02:08,663
I'll wait.

67
00:02:08,663 --> 00:02:10,091
Go get that pen.

68
00:02:10,091 --> 00:02:11,518
Got it?

69
00:02:11,518 --> 00:02:12,946
Good.

70
00:02:12,946 --> 00:02:14,373
Let's continue.

71
00:02:14,373 --> 00:02:16,138
Here they are.

72
00:02:16,138 --> 00:02:17,903
Twenty-five random words.

73
00:02:17,903 --> 00:02:19,668
They look meaningless, but these words ARE your wallet.

74
00:02:19,668 --> 00:02:21,432
Let me explain what that means.

75
00:02:21,432 --> 00:02:23,197
If you lose your phone tomorrow, these 25 words let

76
00:02:23,197 --> 00:02:24,962
you restore your entire wallet on a new device.

77
00:02:24,962 --> 00:02:26,727
Every coin.

78
00:02:26,727 --> 00:02:28,492
Every transaction.

79
00:02:28,492 --> 00:02:30,256
Everything.

80
00:02:30,256 --> 00:02:32,021
But here's the flip side - and this is critical

81
00:02:32,021 --> 00:02:33,786
- if someone else gets these words, they get your

82
00:02:33,786 --> 00:02:35,551
money.

83
00:02:35,551 --> 00:02:37,316
All of it.

84
00:02:37,316 --> 00:02:39,080
Gone.

85
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:40,845
No bank to call.

86
00:02:40,845 --> 00:02:42,610
No fraud department.

87
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:44,375
No reversing the transaction.

88
00:02:44,375 --> 00:02:46,140
Take your time here.

89
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:47,904
There's no timer.

90
00:02:47,904 --> 00:02:49,669
This is your money we're protecting.

91
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:51,434
So write them down.

92
00:02:51,434 --> 00:02:53,199
Check them twice.

93
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:54,964
Not sure your handwriting is right?

94
00:02:54,964 --> 00:02:56,728
Tap 'Copy' first, paste into a notes app, then verify

95
00:02:56,728 --> 00:02:58,493
what you wrote matches.

96
00:02:58,493 --> 00:03:00,258
Then hide them like your grandmother hid her secret recipes

97
00:03:00,258 --> 00:03:02,023
- somewhere only you know about.

98
00:03:02,023 --> 00:03:03,788
Never, ever share these words with anyone.

99
00:03:03,788 --> 00:03:05,552
Not tech support.

100
00:03:05,552 --> 00:03:07,317
Not your bank.

101
00:03:07,317 --> 00:03:09,082
Not even if someone claiming to be from Zano asks

102
00:03:09,082 --> 00:03:10,847
for them.

103
00:03:10,847 --> 00:03:12,612
We will never ask.

104
00:03:12,612 --> 00:03:14,376
Anyone who does is trying to rob you.

105
00:03:14,376 --> 00:03:16,234
And just like that - you did it!

106
00:03:16,234 --> 00:03:18,092
You now have a private digital wallet that you, and

107
00:03:18,092 --> 00:03:19,950
only you, control.

108
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:21,808
No bank can freeze it.

109
00:03:21,808 --> 00:03:23,666
No government can seize it.

110
00:03:23,666 --> 00:03:25,524
No corporation is tracking every purchase.

111
00:03:25,524 --> 00:03:27,382
Welcome to financial freedom.

112
00:03:27,382 --> 00:03:29,240
No suit and tie required.

113
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:31,353
This is your wallet dashboard.

114
00:03:31,353 --> 00:03:33,465
Think of it like your bank account summary page.

115
00:03:33,465 --> 00:03:35,578
Your balance is up top - zero for now, but

116
00:03:35,578 --> 00:03:37,691
that's about to change.

117
00:03:37,691 --> 00:03:39,803
Below you'll see buttons for the things you'll do most:

118
00:03:39,803 --> 00:03:41,916
Send money out, Receive money in.

119
00:03:41,916 --> 00:03:44,029
Simple as that.

120
00:03:44,029 --> 00:03:46,141
Let's look at those next.

121
00:03:46,141 --> 00:03:48,281
Want someone to send you money?

122
00:03:48,281 --> 00:03:50,421
Tap 'Receive' and you'll see this screen.

123
00:03:50,421 --> 00:03:52,560
That big square is a QR code - it's like

124
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,700
your mailing address in scannable form.

125
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:56,840
Here's the good news: this address is completely safe to

126
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,979
share.

127
00:03:58,979 --> 00:04:01,119
It's public, like your email address.

128
00:04:01,119 --> 00:04:03,259
People can send money TO you using this, but they

129
00:04:03,259 --> 00:04:05,398
can't take money FROM you.

130
00:04:05,398 --> 00:04:07,538
Think of it like giving someone your P.O.

131
00:04:07,538 --> 00:04:09,678
Box number, not your house keys.

132
00:04:09,678 --> 00:04:11,809
When you're ready to send money to someone else, tap

133
00:04:11,809 --> 00:04:13,940
'Send.' You'll enter their wallet address - that long string

134
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:16,071
of letters and numbers - and the amount.

135
00:04:16,071 --> 00:04:18,202
One very important warning: triple-check that address before you hit

136
00:04:18,202 --> 00:04:20,333
send.

137
00:04:20,333 --> 00:04:22,464
Unlike that embarrassing email you sent to the wrong person,

138
00:04:22,464 --> 00:04:24,595
crypto transactions cannot be unsent.

139
00:04:24,595 --> 00:04:26,726
Cannot be reversed.

140
00:04:26,726 --> 00:04:28,857
Cannot be undone.

141
00:04:28,857 --> 00:04:30,988
Copy and paste addresses whenever possible.

142
00:04:30,988 --> 00:04:33,119
Don't try to type them manually.

143
00:04:33,119 --> 00:04:35,250
Your fingers will thank you, and so will your wallet.

144
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:37,381
And if you do make a mistake?

145
00:04:37,381 --> 00:04:39,512
Your only hope is to contact the person who received

146
00:04:39,512 --> 00:04:41,643
it and ask them nicely to send it back.

147
00:04:41,643 --> 00:04:43,774
They're the only ones who can.

148
00:04:43,774 --> 00:04:45,905
So...

149
00:04:45,905 --> 00:04:48,036
don't make mistakes.

150
00:04:48,036 --> 00:04:50,167
Check three times.

151
00:04:50,167 --> 00:04:52,054
That's it.

152
00:04:52,054 --> 00:04:53,940
You've just set up your first privacy wallet.

153
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:55,827
You now have something most people don't - a financial

154
00:04:55,827 --> 00:04:57,713
tool that actually belongs to you.

155
00:04:57,713 --> 00:04:59,599
Remember: guard those 25 words like your life depends on

156
00:04:59,599 --> 00:05:01,486
it.

157
00:05:01,486 --> 00:05:03,372
Because your financial freedom does.

158
00:05:03,372 --> 00:05:05,259
For more tutorials on using your new wallet - sending,

159
00:05:05,259 --> 00:05:07,145
receiving, and keeping your funds secure - check out the

160
00:05:07,145 --> 00:05:09,031
other guides in this series.

161
00:05:09,031 --> 00:05:10,918
You just took your financial future into your own hands.

162
00:05:10,918 --> 00:05:12,804
That's not nothing.

163
00:05:12,804 --> 00:05:14,691
That's everything.

164
00:05:14,691 --> 00:05:16,577
Welcome aboard.
